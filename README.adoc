= OpenXT Release Note Container
:source-highlighter: coderay

== The environment

This Docker container is an extension of the 
https://hub.docker.com/r/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor/[Asciidoctor Docker Contatiner].

== How to use

Run the Docker container:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it --rm -v <your directory>:/documents/ openxt-release
----

Docker will map _<your directory>_ to _/documents_ and this will be your 
working directory upon entering the container.

There are two scripts available under _/release_:

* generate_release.py - Creates a skeleton asciidoc release note file
* generate_pdf.sh - Creates a PDF of an asciidoc file using a custom 
Asciidoctor theme.

=== Release Note Generator

The script _generate_release.py_ will generate a skeleton release note file 
that provides all changes between the two releases provided as commandline 
parameters
